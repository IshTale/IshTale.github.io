## Activity Developer and AI Research Intern - Pilot City
**Project description:** Researched and developed frameworks for using ChatGPT to generate creative, engaging educational activities across various subjects and age groups. Designed and tested activities to align with client needs, ensuring they met educational objectives and engagement standards. Utilized Vue and JavaScript to implement and refine activity interfaces.
### 1. Hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena
Hypothesized that ChatGPT's performance in generating activity ideas depended on well-structured prompts and clear client requirements. This insight guided the creation of frameworks to translate client needs into optimal ChatGPT inputs for consistent and relevant activity suggestions.
```javascript
// Sample prompt structure for ChatGPT API
const prompt = `Create an engaging activity for age group ${ageGroup} on ${topic}`;
const response = generateChatGPT(prompt);
```
### 2. Assumptions on which statistical inference will be based
Assessed that clear subject matter and learning objectives were essential for accurate output from ChatGPT. Conducted iterative testing to evaluate the model's activity quality, analyzing feedback on engagement and effectiveness.
```javascript
// Evaluate engagement based on activity completion rate
if (engagementScore < threshold) {
  refinePrompt(prompt);
}
```
### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
Leveraged ChatGPTâ€™s API to automate activity generation. Integrated Vue and JavaScript to build user interfaces that facilitated interaction with generated activities, allowing clients to provide feedback seamlessly.

### 4. A basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
Recommended future data collection on user engagement, activity completion rates, and client satisfaction to continuously refine prompt frameworks. This data supports further improvements in AI-driven activity creation.
