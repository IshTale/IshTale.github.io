## Euler’s Method Implementation

**Project Overview:** Designed and developed a Python-based application to estimate the y-values of a function using Euler’s Method, a fundamental concept in Calculus for approximating solutions to differential equations.

### Key Features:
- **Euler’s Method Calculation:** Implemented Euler’s method to estimate the solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by iteratively calculating the slope at each step and using it to approximate the next point.
  
- **Tkinter GUI:** Developed a user-friendly graphical interface with Tkinter, allowing users to input function parameters, initial values, and step sizes. The GUI then displays the estimated results and visualizes the function’s graph.

- **Function Visualization:** Integrated Matplotlib to plot the function graph, giving users a visual representation of the function’s behavior and the accuracy of the Euler’s method approximation.

- **Mathematical Libraries:** Used Sympy for symbolic calculations and Numpy for numerical operations, ensuring accuracy and performance in the computation of function values.

### Technologies:
- **Python**
- **Tkinter** (for GUI development)
- **Calculus & Sympy** (for symbolic math and calculations)
- **Matplotlib** (for graph plotting)
- **Numpy** (for numerical operations)
