## AI Program Designer Intern - Pilot City
**Project description:** Developed an automated solution enabling instant creation of publishable programs tailored to user needs, powered by AI-driven code generation based on user-selected templates. Also contributed unique design elements using Figma, integrating them into the programâ€™s existing database for a streamlined user experience.
### 1. Hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena
Hypothesized that manually creating custom programs for users was time-intensive and error-prone. Automation through AI-powered code generation could streamline this process, improving efficiency and reducing human error.
```python
# Hypothetical process automation in Python
def generate_code(template):
    # Code generation logic based on template selection
    return generated_program
```
### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based
Validated that template-based code generation would be reliable across various user needs, assuming a sufficient range of templates. Tested and assessed consistency in generated code output based on template selection and user input.
```python
# Assessing the output quality based on templates
if template_quality_score > threshold:
    code_output_consistent = True
```
### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
Leveraged AI-based code generation models trained on specific programming patterns. Used Figma to design intuitive user templates, considering usability metrics to ensure the designs met user expectations.

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
Suggested ongoing data collection on user feedback and program usage metrics to refine the templates and improve automation. Future data can help optimize template selection and assess the impact of the AI-driven automation on user productivity.
