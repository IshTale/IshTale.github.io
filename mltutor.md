## Machine Learning Tutor - Code 4 Tomorrow

**Role Overview:** Developed and delivered personalized lessons for high school students on foundational machine learning topics, including linear, multilinear, and nonlinear regression models. 
Focused on providing hands-on experience with Python and essential libraries to build practical skills and understanding.

### Key Responsibilities:

**Content Creation and Curriculum Design:** Designed custom lesson plans to introduce students to regression models, ensuring a progression from basic linear regression to more complex multilinear and nonlinear models. 
Tailored content to meet students' specific learning needs and skill levels.

**Hands-On Python Programming:** Provided practical exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts, using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Scipy, and Matplotlib. 
These lessons allowed students to implement regression models, understand data patterns, and visualize their results through code.

**Concept Explanation and Model Evaluation:** Explained the mathematical foundations behind each regression model, helping students understand model selection, the significance of coefficients, and how to interpret results. 
Guided students in evaluating model performance and improving accuracy.

**Mentorship and Problem-Solving Support:** Actively supported students through one-on-one sessions, addressing their questions, clarifying concepts, and troubleshooting code. 
Fostered a supportive learning environment to build studentsâ€™ confidence in applying machine learning techniques.

**Encouragement of Critical Thinking:** Taught students how to analyze the strengths and limitations of each model and encouraged critical thinking on when to use each model type based on data characteristics.
This role allowed me to empower students with a foundational understanding of machine learning through practical, hands-on coding experience, preparing them for more advanced studies and applications in AI.
